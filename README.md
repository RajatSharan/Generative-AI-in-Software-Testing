# Generative-AI-in-Software-Testing
Generative AI is transforming software testing by automating test case generation, enhancing test data creation, and improving defect detection. It enables intelligent test automation, reduces manual effort, and accelerates release cycles by leveraging machine learning models to predict failures and optimize test coverage. This repository contains my learnings and implementations from the **Generative AI in Software Testing** course by Rahul Shetty.
